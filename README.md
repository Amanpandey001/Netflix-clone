# Netflix-clone
I completed html css and basics of figma, so i made this clone as my first html css project, im halfway through js so soo enough we'll get a fully functional front end website (probably)


soo like.... i should've used linear grid or smth, im sorry i didnt really explore css before making this, i will explore it again as i have finished my js today and will try to give life to this deadass website in 2 weeks or so....
